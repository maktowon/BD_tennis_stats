## General info
This is final web application project for my data base course.

It allows to browse through players and tournaments to see the individual statistics or matches.
There is also possibility to compare two players based on matches they faced each other.

It also features to make your own profile and add players to your "Favourite players list" for easier access.

## Data
All the data I used to acomplish this project are taken from here: https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp
